// The Mini App business's owner.
//
// Everything this client knows about Mini Apps that is not layout: the
// catalogue, the view each Mini App is presented in, why a view was cleared, and
// the refusals a start earned. ADR 0020 puts it here rather than in the plugin
// catalogue (whose lifetime is installing packages) or the workspace panel
// (whose lifetime is layout), because the state is per session and the protocol
// is its own.
//
// Framework-free: no React, no DOM, no `window`. A component reads the snapshot
// and submits these commands; a test drives the same commands against a scripted
// port.
//
// Two rules the state exists to enforce:
//
//   * A refused start is a fact about a row, not a toast. The refusal is kept
//     under the plugin id it was about, so the catalogue's apps area and the
//     launcher's picker — two surfaces, one listing — both show it.
//   * A stopped runtime clears the view and says why, and nothing starts again
//     on its own. Only `open` starts a Mini App: a person acts on the catalogue
//     or on the picker, and the Agent acts through the runtime's `miniapp`
//     tool, whose `open` reaches this client through the host presenter.
