# MiniMax Code WebUI package

This package runs the MiniMax Code WebUI and its local runtime on your machine.
It is published to the public npm registry. No GitHub account or personal access
token is required to install it.

```sh
npm install --global @minimax-webui/minimax-code
mcode-webui
```

With npm 12 and later, the modules this package builds have to be allowed
explicitly — npm 12 blocks dependency install scripts unless they are named:

```sh
npm install --global @minimax-webui/minimax-code \
  --allow-scripts=better-sqlite3,bufferutil,node-pty,utf-8-validate
```

Or allow them for every global install:

```sh
npm config set allow-scripts=better-sqlite3,bufferutil,node-pty,utf-8-validate --location=user
```

An install that skipped them leaves `better-sqlite3` without its binding, and
`mcode-webui` then stops at startup and prints the reinstall command instead of
running. npm 11 and earlier print the same warning but still run the scripts.

The server listens on `http://127.0.0.1:2233/`. Set `WEBUI_SERVER_PORT` to
change the port or `MINIMAX_DATA_DIR` to change the local data directory. The
default data directory is `~/.minimax`.

Use `mcode-webui --help` or `mcode-webui --version` without starting the runtime
or opening the database.

To allow access without the WebUI's per-start token, start with:

```sh
mcode-webui --full-access
```

This disables token authentication for all WebUI HTTP routes and WebSocket channels,
including files, session transfer/import, extension downloads and the Mini App proxy's
HTTP and WebSocket services. The printed access URLs omit the token. To bind on all
interfaces as well, set `WEBUI_HOST=0.0.0.0`; the flag itself does not change the bind
address. Anyone who can reach these services has access to their WebUI operations.
Host and Origin checks, Chrome/Edge extension pairing, account/provider credentials
and Agent tool permission settings retain their existing behavior. Without the flag,
the existing token authentication applies.

When a schema migration or compatibility repair is needed, startup first creates
and verifies a SQLite backup. It prints the copy progress and the start of the
integrity check. The copy uses a stable WAL read snapshot so another host's writes
do not restart it. A copy with no progress for 60 seconds, or taking more than
10 minutes, stops before schema migration and removes its incomplete backup.
Check available disk space and storage performance before retrying. The read
snapshot can temporarily retain WAL pages while other hosts continue writing.

`mcode-webui` opens the page in your default browser once the server is
listening. Set `WEBUI_OPEN_BROWSER=0` to keep it from doing that; with the
variable unset it stays quiet when the command's output is not a terminal, so a
script, a service supervisor or a CI job never takes over the desktop.

The package requires a supported Node.js version shown in its `engines` field.
